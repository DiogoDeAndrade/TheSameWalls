Developed for the September/October [Game Creators Club](https://game-creators-club.itch.io/) at Lusofona University, with theme "One Room".

The game as it stands is still incomplete, I started raising the bar while I was developing it and I couldn't build the complete game the way I wanted in the three days I could muster to work on this. One day I'll revisit this, for sure; the story is completely incomplete, and I have some interesting ideas I'd like to explore.

## Game

![Title](Screenshots/screen02.png)

"The Same Walls" is an atmospheric narrative puzzle game set entirely in one room.
You play as Caleb, a teenager that avoids leaving his bedroom.
At the start of each act, you overhear fragments of conversation through the door - moments that slowly reveal what's happening in Caleb's life.
To move the story forward, you must interact with objects, complete small tasks, and finally leave the room to face what waits outside.

The story tackles themes of illness, death and domestic conflict. If you might be triggered by domestic violence, cancer and death, maybe give this one a skip.
