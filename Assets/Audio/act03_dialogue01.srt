1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,948
[speaker=none]*knock on door*

2
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:04,308
[speaker=none]*footsteps*

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:05,432
 [speaker=none]*door opens*

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,725
Oh… hi.
I wasn’t expecting you.

5
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,451
 [speaker=Neighbor]I just wanted to check in.
How’s she doing?

6
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:19,325
Back at the hospital again.
They’re trying something new… but…

7
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:24,080
*sigh* It’s just getting harder to pretend, you know?

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,280
[speaker=Neighbor]She’s a fighter.

9
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:29,897
Yeah. That’s what they all say.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,948
Fighters.
Like that makes a difference.

11
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:37,005
I don’t even know who I am when she’s not here.

12
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:40,040
But when she is… it’s worse.

13
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:44,672
I’m supposed to be strong.
For her. For him.

14
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:48,392
 But I’m…
I’m breaking too.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,832
And there’s no one left to lean on.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,368
[speaker=Neighbor]You don’t have to do this alone.

17
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:58,848
…Yeah. Maybe I don’t.

18
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:02,936
[speaker=none]*rustling sounds*

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,320
[speaker=Neighbor]If you need anything at all…
I’m here.

20
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:09,000
[speaker=none]*door closes*

21
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:13,800
I just hope… it’s the last time.
